# VirtualMachine
This Virtual Machine (VM) is a lightweight computing environment implemented in Python that follows the fundamental fetch-decode-execute cycle of computer architecture. The VM processes assembly-like instructions from a text source file (myVM_Prog.txt) and generates output in a separate file (myVM_Output.txt).
